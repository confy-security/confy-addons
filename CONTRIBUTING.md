## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch for Your Changes

Always create a separate branch for each contribution:

```bash
# Update from the main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b type/short-description

# Example branch names:
# - feature/add-aes-validation
# - bugfix/fix-decryption-error
# - docs/improve-readme
# - test/increase-rsa-coverage
```

**Branch naming conventions:**

- `feature/` - For new features
- `bugfix/` - For bug fixes
- `docs/` - For documentation improvements
- `test/` - For adding/improving tests
- `refactor/` - For code refactoring

### 2. Make Your Changes

Make changes to the code following the project standards (see [Code Standards](#code-standards) section).

```bash
# Edit files as needed
vim confy_addons/encryption/aes.py

# See the status of changes
git status

# Stage changes
git add .
```

### 3. Commit with Clear Messages

Write descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add AES key size validation"
```

**Best practices for commit messages:**

- Use the imperative mood ("add" instead of "added")
- Start with a capital letter
- Don't use a period at the end
- Limit the first line to 50 characters
- Add a more detailed description after a blank line if needed

**Complete example:**

```txt
Fix decryption error in CFB mode

- Validate minimum IV size
- Improve error messages
- Add edge case test
```

## Code Standards

The Confy Addons project follows rigorous quality and style standards. Understanding these standards is essential.

### Style and Formatting - Ruff

The project uses **Ruff** for static analysis and code formatting.

**Active rules:**

- `I` - Import sorting
- `F` - Pyflakes errors
- `E` - PEP 8 style errors
- `W` - PEP 8 style warnings
- `PL` - Pylint
- `PT` - Pytest
- `D` - Docstrings (Pydocstyle)
- `UP` - Syntax updates
- `PERF` - Performance optimizations

**Main configurations:**

- Maximum line length: **99 characters**
- Quote style: **Single quotes** (`'`)
- Preview: Enabled (uses experimental Ruff features)

### Style Examples

**‚úÖ Correct:**

```python
"""Module docstring explaining the module."""

from confy_addons.core.constants import AES_KEY_SIZE
from confy_addons.core.exceptions import EncryptionError


class MyEncryption:
    """Docstring for the class."""

    def __init__(self, key: bytes) -> None:
        """Initialize encryption handler.

        Args:
            key: The encryption key.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If key is not bytes.

        """
        if not isinstance(key, bytes):
            raise TypeError('key must be bytes')
        self._key = key

    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:
        """Encrypt plaintext string.

        Args:
            plaintext: The text to encrypt.

        Returns:
            str: The encrypted text.

        """
        try:
            # implementation
            return encrypted_text
        except Exception as e:
            raise EncryptionError('Encryption failed') from e
```

**‚ùå Incorrect:**

```python
# Missing module docstring
from confy_addons.core.exceptions import EncryptionError
from confy_addons.core.constants import AES_KEY_SIZE  # Wrong order

class MyEncryption:
    # Missing class docstring

    def __init__(self, key: bytes) -> None:  # Missing method docstring
        if not isinstance(key, bytes):
            raise TypeError("key must be bytes")  # Double quotes instead of single
        self._key = key

    def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:  # Missing docstring
        try:
            return encrypted_text
        except Exception as e:
            raise EncryptionError("Encryption failed") from e  # Double quotes
```

### Type Hints

Use type hints in all public methods:

```python
def encrypt(self, plaintext: str) -> str:
    """Encrypt plaintext."""
    ...

def decrypt(self, b64_ciphertext: str) -> str:
    """Decrypt ciphertext."""
    ...

@property
def key(self) -> bytes:
    """Return the encryption key."""
    return self._key
```

### Docstrings

Follow the **Google Style** standard for docstrings:

```python
def method(self, arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """Brief description of what the method does.

    Longer description if needed, explaining the behavior
    and any important details.

    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1.
        arg2: Description of arg2.

    Returns:
        bool: Description of return value.

    Raises:
        ValueError: When X condition happens.
        TypeError: When Y type is invalid.

    """
```

### Constants

Use constants for magic values (already defined in `confy_addons/core/constants.py`):

```python
from confy_addons.core.constants import AES_KEY_SIZE, AES_IV_SIZE

# ‚úÖ Correct
key_size = AES_KEY_SIZE

# ‚ùå Incorrect
key_size = 32  # Magic number!
```

### Logging

Use the `logging` module for messages:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log at appropriate levels
logger.debug('Debug information')
logger.info('Important information')
logger.warning('Important warning')
logger.error('An error occurred')
```

## Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to ensure quality. All are automatically executed by Taskipy commands.

### Ruff - Code Analysis and Formatting

**Check code:**

```bash
task lint
# or manually:
poetry run ruff check .
```

**Format code automatically:**

```bash
task format
# or manually:
poetry run ruff format .
poetry run ruff check . --fix
```

### MyPy - Type Checking

Checks the correctness of type hints:

```bash
task mypy
# or manually:
poetry run mypy -p confy_addons -p tests
```

**Example of detected error:**

```python
# MyPy will complain about this:
x: int = "string"  # Invalid type
```

### Radon - Code Complexity

Analyzes cyclomatic complexity:

```bash
task radon
# or manually:
poetry run radon cc ./confy_addons -a -na
```

**A** = average | **NA** = non-aggregated (shows details per function)

### Bandit - Security

Checks for security issues:

```bash
task bandit
# or manually:
poetry run bandit -r ./confy_addons
```

## Testing

Tests are fundamental. All pull requests should maintain or increase test coverage.

### Testing Framework - Pytest

The project uses **Pytest** with coverage plugin.

**Test structure:**

- Tests are in `tests/`
- File names: `test_*.py`
- Function names: `test_*`
- One test per aspect/functionality

### Run Tests

**Run all tests:**

```bash
task test
# or manually:
poetry run pytest -s -x --cov=confy_addons -vv
```

**Run tests from a specific file:**

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_aes.py -v
```

**Run a specific test:**

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_aes.py::test_aes_key_generation_length -v
```

**Run with HTML coverage report:**

```bash
task test
# Coverage HTML will be in: htmlcov/index.html
```

**Useful flags:**

- `-v` or `--verbose` - Verbose mode (shows each test)
- `-s` - Show prints (without capturing stdout)
- `-x` - Stop at first failure
- `--cov=confy_addons` - Measure module coverage
- `--cov-report=html` - Generate HTML report

### Write Tests

**Example of a good test:**

```python
import pytest
from confy_addons import AESEncryption
from confy_addons.core.exceptions import EncryptionError


def test_aes_encrypt_decrypt_roundtrip():
    """Test that encrypt followed by decrypt returns original text."""
    aes = AESEncryption()
    original = 'Hello, World!'
    
    encrypted = aes.encrypt(original)
    decrypted = aes.decrypt(encrypted)
    
    assert decrypted == original


def test_aes_encrypt_invalid_type_raises_error():
    """Test that encrypt raises TypeError with non-string input."""
    aes = AESEncryption()
    
    with pytest.raises(TypeError, match='plaintext must be a str'):
        aes.encrypt(b'bytes-not-allowed')


def test_aes_init_invalid_key_length_raises_error():
    """Test that initializing with wrong key length raises ValueError."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='AES key must be 32 bytes'):
        AESEncryption(key=b'short-key')
```

**Best practices for tests:**

- One behavior per test
- Descriptive names that explain the test
- Use docstrings to explain the test
- Arrange ‚Üí Act ‚Üí Assert
- Test both normal and edge cases
- Test exceptions

## Running the Project Locally

### Pre-test Mode (Before Committing)

Run all checks before committing:

```bash
task pre_test
```

This executes:

1. Ruff (linting)
2. Ruff (format check)
3. MyPy (type checking)

### Complete Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. Make changes to the code
vim confy_addons/encryption/aes.py

# 2. Check style (will be auto-corrected)
task format

# 3. Run tests locally
task test

# 4. Check types
task mypy

# 5. Check security
task bandit

# 6. If all passes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Troubleshooting

Error: Poetry not found

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry --version
```

Error: Virtual environment not activated

```bash
poetry shell
# or use 'poetry run' before each command
```
