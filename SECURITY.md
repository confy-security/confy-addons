# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to Confy Addons. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly to us immediately.

### ⚠️ Important

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public disclosure can put the entire community at risk. Instead, please follow the responsible disclosure process outlined below.

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

### Step 1: Send a Report

Send an email to: **[confy@henriquesebastiao.com](mailto:confy@henriquesebastiao.com)**

Include the following information in your report:

```txt

- **7 days:** We confirm the vulnerability status
- **14 days:** We provide an estimated patch timeline
- **Ongoing:** Regular updates on progress

## What Happens After You Report

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - We confirm receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. **Analysis** - Our security team analyzes the vulnerability
3. **Verification** - We verify the vulnerability in our codebase
4. **Development** - We develop and test a fix
5. **Release** - We release a patched version
6. **Disclosure** - We publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit you (if desired)

### Communication

- We will keep you informed throughout the process
- We will discuss the vulnerability details only with those who need to know
- We will not disclose your identity without permission
- We will ask for your consent before crediting you publicly

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

### Embargo Period

After we acknowledge a vulnerability report, we enforce an embargo period:

- **Critical vulnerabilities:** 30 days maximum before public disclosure
- **High severity vulnerabilities:** 45 days maximum before public disclosure
- **Medium severity vulnerabilities:** 60 days maximum before public disclosure
- **Low severity vulnerabilities:** 90 days maximum before public disclosure

During this period, we request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.

### Public Disclosure

After the embargo period or when a patch is released (whichever comes first), we will:

1. Release a security patch
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit the reporter (with permission)
4. Provide mitigation guidance for users who cannot update immediately

## Supported Versions

### Version Support Timeline

We provide security updates for:

| Version | Release Date | End of Life | Status |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1.x     | 2025-10-21  | TBD        | Actively supported |
| 0.x     | 2025-08-08  | 2025-11-22 | End of Life (3 months) |

### Python Version Support

We support the following Python versions:

- Python 3.9.2+
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11
- Python 3.12
- Python 3.13
- Python 3.14

Security updates will be provided for the last 5 minor versions of Python.

## Known Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Implementation

Confy Addons provides cryptographic functions for encryption and decryption. Users should be aware:

- ✔️ **We use industry-standard libraries** - We rely on the `cryptography` library, which is actively maintained and audited
- ✔️ **We implement best practices** - We use OAEP padding for RSA and CFB mode for AES
- ⚠️ **Key management is your responsibility** - You must securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys
- ⚠️ **Not a complete solution** - This library provides encryption primitives, not a complete security solution

### Dependency Security

We actively monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Dependabot** - Automated dependency monitoring
- **Regular audits** - Manual security reviews
- **Rapid patching** - Quick updates when vulnerabilities are discovered

## Security Best Practices for Users

### When Using Confy Addons

1. **Keep Python updated** - Use the latest supported Python version
2. **Keep dependencies updated** - Run `pip install --upgrade cryptography`
3. **Generate strong keys** - Use proper key sizes (RSA: 4096+ bits, AES: 256 bits)
4. **Secure key storage** - Store cryptographic keys securely, never in version control
5. **Validate input** - Always validate and sanitize data before encryption
6. **Handle errors properly** - Don't expose error details to end users
7. **Use HTTPS** - When transmitting keys or encrypted data over the network
8. **Review code** - Audit any cryptographic implementation in your application

### Key Management

```python
# ✅ Good: Generate and store securely
from confy_addons import RSAEncryption

rsa = RSAEncryption()
private_key = rsa.private_key

# Store private_key securely (e.g., hardware security module, encrypted storage)
# Never commit to version control
# Use environment variables or secure config files

# ❌ Bad: Don't do this
private_key_hardcoded = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."  # DON'T!
```

### Secure Communication

```python
# ✅ Good: Transmit only public key
from confy_addons import RSAEncryption

rsa = RSAEncryption()
public_key_b64 = rsa.base64_public_key  # Safe to share

# ❌ Bad: Never transmit private key
private_key_b64 = rsa.serialized_public_key  # DON'T transmit this!
```

## Security Features

### What Confy Addons Provides

- **RSA Encryption** - 4096-bit asymmetric encryption with OAEP padding
- **AES Encryption** - 256-bit symmetric encryption in CFB mode
- **Key Serialization** - Safe base64 encoding of public keys
- **Error Handling** - Custom exceptions for encryption/decryption errors
- **Type Safety** - Strong type hints for security-critical functions

### What Confy Addons Does NOT Provide

- ❌ **Key generation from passwords** - Use a proper key derivation function
- ❌ **Key agreement protocols** - Use protocols like ECDH for key exchange
- ❌ **Digital signatures** - Use RSA-PSS or ECDSA for signing
- ❌ **Message authentication** - Use HMAC or authenticated encryption modes
- ❌ **Secure random number generation** - We use the system's `secrets` module

For these features, consider using the `cryptography` library directly or other specialized libraries.

## Responsible Disclosure Examples

### ✅ Responsible Disclosure

- Email the security team privately
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Give reasonable time to patch
- Don't share exploit code publicly
- Wait for a patch before public disclosure

### ❌ Irresponsible Disclosure

- Posting vulnerability details on social media
- Opening a public GitHub issue
- Sharing exploit code publicly
- Demanding immediate payment or recognition
- Ignoring the reporting process
